                            I'm J.P. King, and I'm currently transitioning from my the world of restaurants to a career in web development. Originally from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, I studied German and theatre technology at Lycoming College. After graduating in 2019, I spent a few years working in bustling kitchens before deciding that I need more challenge in my life. I've been interested in coding for years, but never truly dug into it. Looking for a change, I dedicated myself to a coding bootcamp.

                            I loved it within the first week. The challenge of learning new things every day, the problem solving inherent in coding, seeing a website take shape as I tap away on my keyboard, all of it. My fascination hasn't faded as I've progressed through the course, and I'm eager to explore new horizons and find a place in the limitless world of web development.
